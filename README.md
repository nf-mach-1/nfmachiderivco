The output.txt contains the results of the good match, when comparing the first set with the second set.
The output2.txt contains the results of the good match, when comparing the second set with the first set.
The file.csv contains the names and gender of the people I want to calculate whether they match or not.
The logs.txt file contains the logs such as execution time, wrong word match entries.
